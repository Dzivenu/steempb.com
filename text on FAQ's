First sentence of “What’s in this stuff?” should be replaced with:
STEEM is made with natural peanut butter, and no artificial sweeteners.

Also, under “One Last Thing,” I would like the “STEEM = PEOPLE FOOD” to be on one line and not broken up like it is. All I can hear is Chuck Heston screaming about how Steem is made of people.
